## Histoire (UI storyboard)

### Project structure

1. If a story is bound to a specific component, it can be placed beside the component in the `src` folder. e.g., `MyComponent.story.vue`
2. If a story is not bound to a specific component, then it should be placed in the `stories` folder. e.g., `MyStory.story.vue`
