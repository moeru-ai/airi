<h1 align="center">ðŸ”® Alaya</h1>

> Where `alaya` stands for **storehouse** or **repository** in Sanskrit, from the word **é˜¿è³´è€¶è­˜** ("All-encompassing foundation consciousness") in Buddhism, you may think it means "to store the memories, data, and all the related knowledge in a single well-managed place".
