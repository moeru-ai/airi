Have you dreamed about having a cyber living being (cyber waifu / husbando, digital pet) or digital companion that could play with and talk to you?

With the power of modern large language models like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) and famous [Claude](https://claude.ai), asking a virtual being to roleplay and chat with us is already easy enough for everyone. Platforms like [Character.ai (a.k.a. c.ai)](https://character.ai) and [JanitorAI](https://janitorai.com/) as well as local playgrounds like [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern) are already good-enough solutions for a chat based or visual adventure game like experience.

> But, what about the abilities to play games? And see what you are coding at? Chatting while playing games, watching videos, and capable of doing many other things.

Perhaps you know [Neuro-sama](https://www.youtube.com/@Neurosama) already. She is currently the best virtual streamer capable of playing games, chatting, and interacting with you and the participants. Some also call this kind of being "digital human." **Sadly, as it's not open sourced, you cannot interact with her after her live streams go offline**.

Therefore, this project, AIRI, offers another possibility here: **let you own your digital life, cyber living, easily, anywhere, anytime**.
